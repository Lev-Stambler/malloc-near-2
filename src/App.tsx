          To make use of the NEAR blockchain, you need to sign in. The button

          By default, when your app runs in "development" mode, it connects to a
          test network ("testnet") wallet. This works just like the main network
          ("mainnet") wallet, but the NEAR Tokens on testnet aren't convertible
          to other currencies â€“ they're just for testing!
